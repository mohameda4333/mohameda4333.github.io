            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>This freedom project of the year is about the persons main topic. It talks about their career and what they want to mainly focus on during their life. This project takes the person to the final project through various steps. First, they talk about their career/topic, then they research more about its hardware/software, and finally, they get to the point where they make their final website about their topic. This website is the final result of everything they have been talking about for the year. </p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>My topic mainly talks about the inventions of medicine we have today and possible inventions in the future. I wanted to talk about medicine because it has always been something I wanted to learn more about. I want to be the reason that a person survives from a dangerous situation due to medicine. I want to make new observations that weren't found out by doctors today. As a result, my freedom project revolved mainly about the inventions of medicine today and the inventions of medicine that could be very useful in the possible future. I made my website that talks about my topic of medicine. I also talked about the current invention we have today made my doctors. This invention is called the pill dispenser that dispenses pills to make it easier for people, especially the elderly, to take their pills. A possible future invention that I came up with is the brain scanner. This invention could be very significant for doctors when we get the right technology to make it. All this information is included in my website as well as interactive A-Frame models that describe these inventions visually.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project was very fun to participate in but it also had many challenges along the way. For example, throughout semester 2, I was very slow with the work I had to finish in this class and other classes. I couldn't really keep up with this work because I was lazy. As time passed, the work just kept stacking up on top of each other until I couldn't do anything anymore. As a result, this challenge taught me to finish all my work on time even if I have to manage my time outside of school or I will fall down. I also learned not to stress everything too much because it will cause me to be lazy and not finish my work. My next step is to manage my time and really focus in school because I want my parents to be proud of me and I want to have a good future.</p>
