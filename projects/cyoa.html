            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>This CYOA Webpage Project is a project that encourages students to be creative and make atleast 10 files that each have a purpose. For example, students should make files that are navigated to based on the choices they make. If a student makes a choice, they press on a link that leads them to another file. This project helps boost students creativity as the files depend on any topic. A planning page is also necessary to see what the students have came up with.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>Our project is mainly about fighting a giant beast. This project is similar to a roleplay as the student who is playing makes the choices. Our project starts off as a man that ends up in a forest. The man is tired and can either sleep on a big Rock or he accidentally steps on a stick. Then we have more choices depending on what the student has picked. You can either completely kill the beast, run away from the beast, or die by the beasts hands. This story only has one bad result that can cause you to lose. Students are meant to choose wisely as they would if they were really in the situation.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project was very fun to make as it helped me practice markdown files in my IDE. On the outside of the files, a student simply presses a link and is led to another file. However, on the inside is very easy compared to link navigation in HTML. All that we have to do is write the text that we want to show in brackets and with no spaces, write the markdown file of a different file in paranthesis. All files should be in this form: "example.md". One challenge that I faced was adding an image to the "diagram.png". I was confused because I couldn't use the `<img src="example">` in github so I struggled to add an image.</p>
