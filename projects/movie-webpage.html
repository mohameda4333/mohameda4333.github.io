            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>This Movie Webpage Project is a project that encourages students to make a code based on an original movie that they made. This project helps boost students creativity as they have to make a topic as a movie. To do this, the students must use HTML and CSS to code the project and to make it match the theme that they are using. For example, they can use themes like creepy, action, comedy, fun, and etc.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>Our project talks about a moment that could potentially occur if Technology were to malfunction. This story is mostly about a horror movie of malfunctioning robots that try take over humanity. It is a Sci-Fi movie with only one outcome. Can Humanity be saved or will it be conquered by the genius robots. A group of ordinary people: a scientist, a hacker, and a few regular citizens must team up to stop the A.I. before it's too late. But with the machines always one step ahead, can they outsmart them and save the world?</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>One of My biggest challenges when making the project was the styling of the project and the input button. Styling the project was really difficult because me and my partner were confused on what font would make our project look good and scary for our theme. The input button was also hard to function because we were confused on how to make the text in the input button dissapear after pressing submit. My takeways from this project are the support and creativity that comes with it. It helped me understand that it's easier to be able to work with your partner to decide on things together, making the project exceed one persons limit if they were working by themself. This project was also very fun to create as the topic is very interesting because it hooks the reader to understand to the project. Our next steps are going to be the use of input buttons. This time, we couldn't fully understand how the input button works so we added only one input button. However, next time, we will add more input buttons to make the project easier to interact with.</p>
